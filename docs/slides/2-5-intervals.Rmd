## Frequentist confidence intervals

- Recall that a frequentist confidence interval  $[l(y), \ u(y)]$ has 95% frequentist coverage for a population parameter $\theta$ if, before we collect the data,
.block[
$$\Pr[l(y) < \theta < u(y) | \theta] = 0.95.$$
]

--

- This means that 95% of the time, our constructed interval will cover the true parameter, and 5% of the time it won't.

--

- In any given sample, you don't know whether you're in the lucky 95% or the unlucky 5%.


---
## Frequentist confidence intervals

- You just know that either the interval covers the parameter, or it doesn't (useful, but not too helpful clearly). 

--

- There is NOT a 95% chance your interval covers the true parameter once you have collected the data.

--

- Asking about the definition of a confidence interval is tricky, even for those who know what they're doing.



---
## Bayesian intervals

- An interval $[l(y), \ u(y)]$ has 95% Bayesian coverage for $\theta$ if
.block[
$$\Pr[l(y) < \theta < u(y) | Y=y] = 0.95.$$
]

--

- This describes our information about where $\theta$ lies _after_ we observe the data.

--

- Fantastic!

--

- This is actually the interpretation people want to give to the frequentist confidence interval.

--

- Bayesian interval estimates are often generally called .hlight[credible intervals].



---
## Bayesian quantile-based interval

- The easiest way to obtain a Bayesian interval estimate is to use posterior quantiles.

--

- Easy since we either know the posterior densities exactly or can sample from the distributions.

--

- To make a $100 \times (1-\alpha)%$ quantile-based credible interval, find numbers (quantiles) $\theta_{\alpha/2} < \theta_{1-\alpha/2}$ such that

  1. $\Pr(\theta < \theta_{\alpha/2} | Y=y) = \dfrac{\alpha}{2}$; and
  
  2. $\Pr(\theta > \theta_{1-\alpha/2} | Y=y) = \dfrac{\alpha}{2}$.
  
--

- This is an .hlight[equal-tailed interval]. Often when researchers refer to a credible interval, this is what they mean.



---
## Equal-tailed quantile-based interval

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="370px",out.width="700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hpd.png")
```

- This is Figure 3.6 from the Hoff book. Focus on the quantile-based credible interval for now.

--

- Note that there are values of $\theta$ outside the quantile-based credible interval, with higher density than some values inside the interval. 



---
## HPD region

- A $100 \times (1-\alpha)%$ highest posterior density (HPD) region is a subset $s(y)$ of the parameter space $\Theta$ such that

  1. $\Pr(\theta \in s(y) | Y=y) = 1-\alpha$; and
  
  2. If $\theta_a \in s(y)$ and $\theta_b \notin s(y)$, then $\Pr(\theta_a | Y=y) > \Pr(\theta_b | Y=y)$.

--

- $\Rightarrow$ **All** points in a HPD region have higher posterior density than points outside the region. 

  *Note this region is not necessarily a single interval (e.g., in the case of a multimodal posterior).*
  
--

- The basic idea is to gradually move a horizontal line down across the density, including in the HPD region all values of $\theta$ with a density above the horizontal line.

--

- Stop moving the line down when the posterior probability of the values of $\theta$ in the region reaches $1-\alpha$.



---
## HPD region

Hoff Figure 3.6 shows how to construct an HPD region.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="450px",out.width="700px"}
