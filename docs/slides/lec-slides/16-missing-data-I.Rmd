# Missing data


---
## Motivation

- Most real world datasets often suffer from nonresponse, that is, they contain missing values.

--

- Ideally, analysts should first decide on how to deal with missing data before moving on to analysis. 

--

- One needs to make assumptions and ask tons of questions, for example,
  + why are the values missing?
  + what is the pattern of missingness?
  + what is the proportion of missing values in the data?

--

- As a Bayesian, one could treat the missing values as parameters and estimate them simultaneously with the analysis, but even in that case, one must still ask the same questions.

--

- Ask as many questions as possible to help you figure out the most plausible assumptions!


---
## Motivation

- Simplest approach: complete/available case analyses -- delete cases with missing data. Often problematic because:
  + it is just not feasible sometimes (small $n$ large $p$ problem) -- when we have a small number of observations but a large number of variables, we simply can not afford to throw away data, even when the proportion of missing data is small.
  
--

  + information loss -- even when we do not have the small $n$, large $p$ problem, we still lose information when we delete cases.
  
--

  + biased results -- because the missing data mechanism is rarely random, features of the observed data can be completely different from the missing data.

--
  
- More principled approach: impute the missing data (in a statistically proper fashion) and analyze the imputed data.



---
## Why should we care?

- <font color="red">Loss of power</font> due to the the smaller sample size
  + can't regain lost power

--
  
- Any analysis must make an <font color="red">untestable assumption</font> about the missing data
  + wrong assumption $\Rightarrow$ <font color="red">biased estimates</font>

--
  
- Some popular analyses with missing data get <font color="red">biased standard errors</font>
  + resulting in wrong p-values and confidence intervals

--

- Some popular analyses with missing data are <font color="red">inefficient</font>
  + so that confidence intervals are wider than they need be


---
## What to do: loss of power

Approach by design:

- minimize amount of missing data
  + good communications with participants, for example, patients in clinical trial, participants in surveys and censuses, etc
  + follow up as much as possible; make repeated attempts using different methods

--
    
- reduce the impact of missing data
  + collect reasons for missing data
  + collect information predictive of missing values
    
    
---
## What to do: analysis

- A suitable method of analysis would:
  + make the correct (or plausible) assumption about the missing data
  + give an unbiased estimate (under that assumption)
  + give an unbiased standard error (so that p-values and confidence intervals are correct)
  + be efficient (make best use of the available data)

--
  
- However, we can never be sure about what the correct assumption is $\Rightarrow$ sensitivity analyses are essential!


---
## How to approach the analysis?

- Start by knowing:
  + extent of missing data
  + pattern of missing data (e.g. is $X_1$ always missing whenever $X_2$ is also missing?)
  + predictors of missing data and of outcome

--
  
- Principled approach to missing data:
  + identify a plausible assumption (through discussions between you as a data scientist and your clients)
  + choose an analysis method that's valid under that assumption
  
--

- Just because a method is simple to use does not make it plausible; some analysis methods are simple to describe but have complex and/or implausible assumptions.


---
## Types of nonresponse (missing data)

- .hlight[Unit nonresponse]: the individual has no values recorded for any of the variables. For example, when participants do not complete a survey questionnaire at all.

- .hlight[Item nonresponse]: the individual has values recorded for at least one variable, but not all variables.

## Types of Missing Data Mechanism

- Data are said to be .hlight[missing completely at random (MCAR)] if the reason for missingness does not depend on the values of the observed data or missing data.

--

- For example, suppose
  - you handed out a double-sided survey questionnaire of 20 questions to a sample of participants;
  - questions 1-15 were on the first page but questions 16-20 were at the back; and
  - some of the participants did not respond to questions 16-20.
 
--
 
- Then, the values for questions 16-20 for those people who did not respond would be .hlight[missing completely at random] if they simply did not realize the pages were double-sided; they had no reason to ignore those questions.
 
--
 
- This is rarely plausible in practice!


---
## Types of Missing Data Mechanism

- Data are said to be .hlight[missing at random (MAR)] if the reason for missingness may depend on the values of the observed data but not the missing data (conditional on the values of the observed data).

--

- Using our previous example, suppose
  - questions 1-15 include demographic information such as age and education;
  - questions 16-20 include income related questions; and
  - once again, some of the participants did not respond to questions 16-20.

--
  
- Then, the values for questions 16-20 for those people who did not respond would be .hlight[missing at random] if younger people are more likely not to respond to those income related questions than old people, where age is observed for all participants.
  
--

- This is the most commonly assumed mechanism in practice!


---
## Types of Missing Data Mechanism

- Data are said to be .hlight[missing not at random (MNAR or NMAR)] if the reason for missingness depends on the actual values of the missing (unobserved) data.

--

- Continuing with our previous example, suppose again that
  - questions 1-15 include demographic information such as age and education;
  - questions 16-20 include income related questions; and
  - once again, some of the participants did not respond to questions 16-20.

--
  
- Then, the values for questions 16-20 for those people who did not respond would be .hlight[missing not at random] if people who earn more money are less likely to respond to those income related questions than old people.

--
  
- This is usually the case in real analysis, but analysis can be complex!


---
## Mathematical Formulation

- Consider the classical multiple regression setting with
.block[
.small[
$$\boldsymbol{Y} = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}; \ \ \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon \boldsymbol{I})$$
]
]

	where $\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity matrix and
.block[
.small[
$$
\boldsymbol{Y} =
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
\vdots\\
y_n \\
\end{bmatrix}
\hspace{0.5em}
\boldsymbol{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots & x_{1p} \\
1 & x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots & x_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \ldots & x_{np} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\hspace{0.5em}
\boldsymbol{\beta} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0\\
\beta_1\\
\beta_2 \\
\vdots \\
\beta_p \\
\end{bmatrix}
\hspace{0.5em}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_1\\
\epsilon_2 \\
\vdots \\
\epsilon_n \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 
]
]

--
	
- Suppose for now, that $\boldsymbol{Y}$ contains missing values but $\boldsymbol{X}$ is fully observed.

--

- We can separate $\boldsymbol{Y}$ into the observed and missing parts, that is, $\boldsymbol{Y} = (\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis})$. 

--

- We can also do the same for $\boldsymbol{X}$ if it contains missing values.


---
## Mathematical Formulation

- Let 
  + $r_i = 1$ when $y_i$ is missing,
  + $r_i = 0$ when $y_i$ is observed.

--

- Also, let 
  + $\boldsymbol{R} = (r_1,\ldots,r_n)$ (this is the vector of missing indicators for $\boldsymbol{Y}$),
  + $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ be the set of parameters associated with $\boldsymbol{R}$.

--

- When $\boldsymbol{X}$ contains missing values, we can also create a vector of missing indicators for each variable in $\boldsymbol{X}$ with missing entries.

--

- Assume $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ and $(\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon)$ are distinct.


---
## Mathematical Formulation

- MCAR:
.block[
$$f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta})$$
]

--

- MAR:
.block[
$$f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta})$$
]

--

- MNAR:
.block[
$$f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta})$$
]



---
## Implications for likelihood function for parameters

- Each type of mechanism has a different implication on the likelihood of the observed data $\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}$, and the missing data indicator $\boldsymbol{R}$.

--

- Without missingness in $\boldsymbol{Y}$, the likelihood function is
.block[
$$L(\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{X}) \propto f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon)$$
]

--

- With missingness in $\boldsymbol{Y}$, the likelihood function is instead
.block[
$$
\begin{split}
L(\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{R}) & \propto f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} |\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
& = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
\end{split}
$$
]

--

- Since we do not actually observe $\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis}$, we would like to be able to integrate it out so we don't have to deal with it.



---
## Likelihood function: MCAR

For MCAR, we have:

.block[
$$
\begin{split}
f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) & = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
& = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
& = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) \int f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
& = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon). \\
\end{split}
$$
]

--

That is, the likelihood function is
.block[
$$
\begin{split}
L(\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{R}) & \propto f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
& = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon). \\
\end{split}
$$
]

--

For inference on $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\sigma^2_\epsilon$, we can simply focus on $f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon)$ in the likelihood function, since $f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta})$ does not include any part of the observed data.



---
## Likelihood function: MAR

For MAR, we have:

.block[
$$
\begin{split}
f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) & = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
& = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
& = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) \int f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
& = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon). \\
\end{split}
$$
]

--

That is, the likelihood function is
.block[
$$
\begin{split}
L(\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{R}) & \propto f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
& = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon). \\
\end{split}
$$
]

--

For inference on $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\sigma^2_\epsilon$, we can again focus on $f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon)$ in the likelihood function. However, $f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta})$ does include the observed data here, so that there would be some bias if we do not account for it.


---
## Likelihood function: MNAR

For MNAR, we have:

.block[
$$
\begin{split}
f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) & = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis}. \\
\end{split}
$$
]

--

  + The likelihood under MNAR cannot simplify any further.
  + In this case, we cannot ignore the missing data when making inferences about $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\sigma^2_\epsilon$.


---
## Types of missing data mechanisms: how to tell in practice?

So how can we tell the type of mechanism we are dealing with? 

--

In general, we don't know!!!

--

- Rare that data are MCAR (unless planned beforehand)

--

- Possible that data are MNAR

--

- Compromise: assume data are MAR if we include enough variables in model for the missing data indicator $\boldsymbol{R}$.

# Strategies for handling missing data


---
## Strategies for handling missing data

- Item nonresponse:
  + use complete/available cases analyses
  + single imputation methods
  + multiple imputation
  + model-based methods

--
  
- Unit nonresponse: 
  + weighting adjustments
  + model-based methods (identifiability issues!).

--
  
- We will only focus on item nonresponse. If you are interested in building models for both unit and item nonresponse, here is a paper on research I have done on the topic: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06145.pdf


---
## Complete/available cases analyses

What can happen when using available case analyses with different types of missing data?

--

- MCAR: unbiased when disregarding missing data; variance increase (losing partially complete data)

--

- MAR: biased (depending on the strength of MAR and amount of missing data) when missing data mechanism is not modeled; variance increase (losing partially complete data). 

--

- NMAR: generally biased!


---
## Why should we care?

- <div class="question">
Why should we care in practice? What does bias really mean here? How exactly does using only the complete cases affect our results for the three mechanisms?
</div>

- Let's attempt to answer these questions via simulations. 

- Set $n = 10,000$. For $i=1,\ldots,n$, generate
  + $x_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(2, 1); \ \  \ y_i|x_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(-1 + 2 x_{i}, \sigma^2=5^2)$
  + $r_i|y_i, x_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 y_i + \theta_2 x_i$
  
- Next, set $y_i$ missing whenever $r_i = 1$.

- Set different values for $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_0, \theta_1, \theta_2)$ to reflect MCAR, MAR and MNAR.

- Let's use the R script [here](https://ids-702-f19.github.io/Course-Website/slides/lec-slides/MissingDataSim.R).


---
## Single imputation methods

--

- Marginal/conditional mean imputation

--

- Nearest neighbor imputation:
  + hot deck imputation
  + cold deck imputation

--

- Use observation from one of the previous time periods (for panel data)
  + LOCF -- last observation carried forward 
  + BOCF -- baseline observation carried forward
  
  
---
## Mean imputation

Plug in the variable mean for missing values.

--

- Point estimates of means OK under MCAR

--

- Variances and covariances underestimated.

--

- Distributional characteristics altered.

--

- Regression coefficients inaccurate.

--

Similar problems for plug-in conditional means.


---
## Nearest neighbor imputation

Plug in donors' observed values.

--

- Hot deck: for each non-respondent, find a respondent who "looks like" the non-respondent in the same dataset

--

- Cold deck: find potential donors in an external but similar dataset. For example, respondents from a 2016 election poll survey might serve as potential donors for non-respondents in the 2018 version of the same survey.

--

- Common metrics: Statistical distance, adjustment cells, propensity scores.


---
## Nearest neighbor imputation

- Point estimates of means OK under MAR.

--

- Variances and covariances underestimated.

--

- Distributional characteristics OK.

--

- Regression coefficients OK under MAR.


---
## Multiple imputation (MI)

- Fill in dataset $m$ times with imputations.

--

- Analyze repeated data sets separately, then combine the estimates from each one.

--

- Imputations drawn from probability models for missing data.

--

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="370px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/MultipleImp.png")
```



---
## MI example

Suppose

- $Y =$ income (unit of measurement is $10,000)

--

- $X =$ level of education (0 = undergraduate, 1 = graduate)

--

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="370px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/MIExample-I.png")
```



---
## MI: inferences from multiply-imputed datasets

Rubin (1987)

- Population estimand: $Q$

- Sample estimate: $q$

- Variance of $q$: $u$

- In each imputed dataset $d_j$, where $j = 1,\ldots,m$, calculate
$$q_j = q(d_j)$$
$$u_j = u(d_j)$$

---
## MI example: inferences from multiply-imputed datasets

Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean income in our example.  Then

- Q = $\mu_Y$

--

- $q = \bar{y} =  \dfrac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} y_i$

--

- u = $\mathbb{\hat{V}}[\bar{y}] = \dfrac{s^2}{n}$

--

- In each imputed dataset $d_j$, calculate
$$q_j =  \bar{y}_j \ \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \ u_j = \dfrac{s_j^2}{n}$$


---
## MI: quantities needed for inference

- .block[
$$\bar{q}_m = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \dfrac{q_i}{m}$$
]

- .block[
$$b_m = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \dfrac{(q_i - \bar{q}_m)^2}{m-1}$$
]

- .block[
$$\bar{u}_m = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \dfrac{u_i}{m}$$
]


---
## MI: inferences from multiply-imputed datasets

- MI estimate of $Q$:
.block[
$$\bar{q}_m$$
]

--

- MI estimate of variance is:
.block[
$$T_m = (1+1/m)b_m + \bar{u}_m$$
]

--
	
- Use t-distribution inference for $Q$
.block[
$$\bar{q}_m \pm t_{1-\alpha/2} \sqrt{T_m}$$
]
	
  .hlight[Notice that the variance incorporates uncertainty both from within and between the m datasets.]



---
## MI example

Back to our income example,

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/MIExample-II.png")
```

--

By the way, $\bar{y}=12.64$ from the "true complete dataset".


---
## MI example

- MI estimate of $Q$: 
.small[
	$$\bar{q}_m = \sum\limits_{j=1}^m \dfrac{q_j}{m} = \dfrac{12.66 + 13.14 + 12.90}{3} = 12.90$$
	]

--

- Between variance 
.small[
	$$b_m = \sum\limits_{j=1}^m \dfrac{(q_j - \bar{q}_m)^2}{m-1} =  0.06$$
	]

--

- Within variance 
.small[
	$$\bar{u}_m = \sum\limits_{j=1}^m \dfrac{u_j}{m} = \dfrac{0.37 + 0.29 + 0.32}{3} = 0.33$$
	]

--

- MI estimate of variance is: 
.small[
	$$T_m = (1+1/m)b_m + \bar{u}_m = (1+1/3)0.06 + 0.33 = 0.41$$
	]

Where should the imputations come from? We will answer that in the next class!
