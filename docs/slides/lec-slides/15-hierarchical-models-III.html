## Outline

- Questions from last lecture

- Bernoulli versus binomial outcomes

- Multilevel logistic models

- Bayesian approach to multilevel logistic models using the `brms` package


---
## Bernoulli versus binomial outcomes

- Before we get into multilevel logistic models, let's review logistic regression models for Bernoulli versus binomial outcomes.

--

- Recall from the summer online review materials that if `\(Y \sim \textrm{Bin}(n,p)\)` (that is, `\(Y\)` is a random variable that follows a binomial distribution with parameters `\(n\)` and `\(p\)`), then `\(Y\)` follows a `\(\textrm{Bernoulli}(p)\)` distribution  when `\(n = 1\)`.

--

- This also implies that if `\(Z_1, \ldots, Z_n \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(p)\)`, then `\(Y = \sum_i^n Z_i \sim \textrm{Bin}(n.p)\)`.

--

- That is, the sum of `\(n\)` iid `\(\textrm{Bernoulli}(p)\)` random variables gives a random variable with the `\(\textrm{Bin}(n,p)\)` distribution.

--

- The logistic regression model can be used either for Bernoulli data (as we have done so far) or for data summarized as binomial counts (that is, aggregated counts).

--

- This is what you have for one part of team project 2.


---
## Bernoulli versus binomial outcomes

Normally, for individual-level data, we would have

.small[

```
##   y x
## 1 0 3
## 2 0 3
## 3 1 2
## 4 1 1
## 5 1 2
## 6 0 3
```
]

.small[

```r
M1 &lt;- glm(y~x,data=Data,family=binomial); summary(M1)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## glm(formula = y ~ x, family = binomial, data = Data)
## 
## Deviance Residuals: 
##    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max  
## -1.261  -1.105  -1.030   1.251   1.332  
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(&gt;|z|)
## (Intercept)   0.1942     0.3609   0.538    0.591
## x2           -0.3660     0.4954  -0.739    0.460
## x3           -0.5508     0.5017  -1.098    0.272
## 
## (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)
## 
##     Null deviance: 138.27  on 99  degrees of freedom
## Residual deviance: 137.02  on 97  degrees of freedom
## AIC: 143.02
## 
## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4
```
]


---
## Bernoulli versus binomial outcomes

But we could also do the following with the aggregate level data instead.
.small[

```
##   x success  n
## 1 1      17 31
## 2 2      16 35
## 3 3      14 34
```
]

.small[

```r
M2 &lt;- glm(cbind(success,n-success)~x,data=Data_agg,family=binomial); summary(M2)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## glm(formula = cbind(success, n - success) ~ x, family = binomial, 
##     data = Data_agg)
## 
## Deviance Residuals: 
## [1]  0  0  0
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(&gt;|z|)
## (Intercept)   0.1942     0.3609   0.538    0.591
## x2           -0.3660     0.4954  -0.739    0.460
## x3           -0.5508     0.5017  -1.098    0.272
## 
## (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)
## 
##     Null deviance: 1.2524e+00  on 2  degrees of freedom
## Residual deviance: 1.3323e-14  on 0  degrees of freedom
## AIC: 17.868
## 
## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 2
```
]

--

Same results overall! Deviance and AIC are different because of the different likelihood functions. Note that some glm functions use `n` instead of `n-success`.

# Multilevel logistic models



---
## Multilevel linear models

- The same idea and approach used to build multilevel models for normal data can be used to build multilevel logistic (and probit) models for binary outcomes.

--

- Recall that for a .hlight[varying-intercepts linear model] with one individual-level predictor, we have
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
y_{ij} &amp; = \beta_{0} + \gamma_{0j} + \beta_1 x_{1ij} + \epsilon_{ij}; \ \ \ i = 1, \ldots, n_j; \ \ \ j = 1, \ldots, J; \\
\epsilon_{ij} &amp; \sim N(0, \sigma^2); \\
\gamma_{0j} &amp; \sim N(0, \tau_0^2)
\end{split}`
$$
]
]

  where `\(x_{1ij}\)` can be replaced with `\(x_{1j}\)` for a group-level predictor.

--

- This model is a compromise between complete pooling across groups of a grouping variable, such as counties in the radon example for last class (that is, same intercept for each county), and no pooling (estimating a separate intercept for each county without borrowing information).

--

- The degree of pooling is determined by the amount of information within and between groups.


---
## Multilevel logistic models

- We can use the same idea to build a .hlight[varying-intercepts logistic model].

- That is,
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
y_{ij} | x_{ij} &amp; \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_{ij}); \ \ \ i = 1, \ldots, n_j; \ \ \ j = 1, \ldots, J; \\
\textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_{ij}}{1-\pi_{ij}}\right) &amp; = \beta_{0} + \gamma_{0j} + \beta_1 x_{1ij}; \\
\gamma_{0j} &amp; \sim N(0, \sigma_0^2)
\end{split}`
$$
]
]

  where once again, `\(x_{1ij}\)` is an individual-level predictor which can be replaced with `\(x_{1j}\)` for a group-level predictor.


--

- The Gelman and Hill book uses the following notation instead
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
y_i | x_i &amp; \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ i = 1, \ldots, n; \ \ \ j = 1, \ldots, J; \\
\textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) &amp; = \beta_{0} + \gamma_{0j[i]} + \beta_1 x_{i1}; \\
\gamma_{0j} &amp; \sim N(0, \sigma_0^2).
\end{split}`
$$
]
]


--

- I will use this notation for the rest of today's class.

## Varying-intercepts logistic model

Inverse logit functions for varying-intercepts logistic models.

---
## Multilevel logistic models

- It is easy to extend this model to allow for .hlight[varying-slopes] instead or both .hlight[varying-intercepts and varying-slopes] just like we had for multilevel linear models.

--

- The interpretations of the fixed effect(s) in multilevel logistic models follow directly from what we had for the standard logistic models, that is, log-odds, odds and odds ratios.

--

- The only difference now is the hierarchy in our data which allows us to borrow information across groups.

--

- One way to think about this is that we expect odds and odd-ratios to be more similar for observations within the same group, but we allow for some similarity across groups via partial pooling.

---
## 1988 elections analysis

- To illustrate how to fit and interpret the results of multilevel logistic models, we will use the election polls example from the Gelman and Hill textbook.

--

- National opinion polls are conducted by a variety of organizations (e.g., media, polling organizations, campaigns) leading up to elections.

--

- While many of the best opinion polls are conducted at a national level, it can also be often interesting to estimate voting opinions and preferences at the state or even local level.

--

- Well-designed polls are generally based on national random samples with corrections for nonresponse based on a variety of demographic factors (e.g., sex, ethnicity, race, age, education).



---
## 1988 elections analysis

- The data is from CBS News surveys conducted during the week before the 1988 election.

--

- Respondents were asked about their preferences for either the Republican candidate (Bush Sr.) or the Democratic candidate (Dukakis). 

--

- Both voting turnout and preferences often depend on a complex combination of demographic factors.

--

- In our example dataset, we have demographic factors such as biological sex, race, age, education, which we may all want to look at by state, resulting in `\(2 \times 2 \times 4 \times 4 \times 51 = 3264\)` potential categories of respondents.

--

- Clearly, without a very large survey (most political survey poll around 1000 people), we will need to make assumptions in order to even obtain estimates in each category.

--

- We usually cannot include all interactions; we should therefore select those to explore (through EDA and background knowledge).



---
## 1988 elections analysis

The dataset includes 2193 observations from one of eight surveys (the most recent CBS News survey right before the election) in the original full data.

.small[
Variable    | Description
:------------- | :------------
org | cbsnyt = CBS/NYT
bush | 1 = preference for Bush Sr., 0 = otherwise
state | 1-51: 50 states including DC (number 9)
edu | education: 1=No HS, 2=HS, 3=Some College, 4=College Grad
age | 1=18-29, 2=30-44, 3=45-64, 4=65+
female | 1=female, 0=male
black | 1=black, 0=otherwise
region | 1=NE, 2=S, 3=N, 4=W, 5=DC
v_prev | average Republican vote share in the three previous elections (adjusted for home-state and home-region effects in the previous elections)

## 1988 elections analysis

- As a start, we will consider a simple model with fixed effects of race and sex and a random effect for state (50 states + the District of Columbia).
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
\textrm{bush}_i | \boldsymbol{x}_i &amp; \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ i = 1, \ldots, n; \ \ \ j = 1, \ldots, J=51; \\
\textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) &amp; = \beta_{0} + \gamma_{0j[i]} + \beta_1 \textrm{female}_{i} + \beta_2 \textrm{black}_{i}; \\
\gamma_{0j} &amp; \sim N(0, \sigma_{\textrm{state}}^2).

- Not ideal; we'll learn about methods for dealing with missing data soon.

--

- Interpretation of results:
  + For a fixed state, a non-black male respondent has odds of `\(e^{0.45}=1.57\)` of supporting Bush.
  + For a fixed state and sex, a black respondent as `\(e^{-1.74}=0.18\)` times (an 82% decrease)  the odds of supporting Bush as a non-black respondent; you are much less likely to support Bush if your race is black compared to being non-black.
  + For a given state and race, a female respondent has `\(e^{-0.10}=0.91\)` (a 9% decrease)  times the odds of supporting Bush as a male respondent. However, this effect is not actually statistically significant!

- The state-level standard deviation is estimated at 0.41, so that the states do vary some, but not so much.

--

-   &lt;div class="question"&gt;
We no longer have a term for residual standard deviation (residual standard error). Why is that?
&lt;/div&gt;

--


- I expect that you will be able to interpret the corresponding confidence intervals.

## 1988 elections analysis

- Let’s fit a more sophisticated model that includes other relevant survey factors, such as 
  + region
  + prior vote history (note that this is a state-level predictor),
  + age, education, and the interaction between them.

- Also, it looks like we have a convergence issue. This can happen when dealing with multilevel models. We have so many parameters to estimate from the interaction terms `edu_label:age_label` (16 actually), and it looks like that's causing a problem. 

--

- Could be that we have too many `\(\textrm{bush}_i = 1\)` or `\(0\)` values for certain combinations. You should check!

--

- Let's treat those as random effects instead. That is,
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
\textrm{logit}\left(\Pr[\textrm{bush}_i = 1] \right) &amp; = \beta_{0} + \gamma_{0m[i]}^{\textrm{region}} + \gamma_{0j[i]}^{\textrm{state}} + \gamma_{0k[i],l[i]}^{\textrm{age.edu}} \\
&amp; + \beta_{\textrm{f}} \textrm{female}_{i} + \beta_{\textrm{b}} \textrm{black}_{i} + \beta_{\textrm{v_prev}} \textrm{v_prev}_{j[i]}; \\
\gamma_{0m} &amp; \sim N(0, \sigma_{\textrm{region}}^2), \ \ \ \gamma_{0j} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\textrm{state}}^2), \ \ \ \gamma_{0k,l} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\textrm{age.edu}}^2).
\end{split}`
$$
]
]

- In `R`, we have
  
  ```r
  model3 &lt;- glmer(bush ~ black + female + v_prev + (1|state_label) + (1|region_label) + 
               (1|edu_label:age_label), family=binomial(link="logit"),data=polls_subset)
  ```

--

- This seems to run fine; we are able to borrow information which will help.

- Remember that in the first model, the state-level standard deviation was estimated as 0.41. Looks like we are now able to separate that (for the most part) into state and region effects.

--

- Interpretation of results:
  + For a fixed state, education and age bracket, a non-black male respondent with zero prior average Republican vote share, has odds of `\(e^{-3.51}=0.03\)` of supporting Bush (no one really has 0 value for `v_prev`).
  + For a fixed state, sex, education level, age bracket and zero prior average Republican vote share, a black respondent has `\(e^{-1.75}=0.17\)` times (an 83% decrease) the odds of supporting Bush as a non-black respondent, which is about the same as before.
  + For each percentage point increase in prior average Republican vote share, residents of a given state, race, sex, education level  age bracket have `\(e^{0.07}=1.07\)` times the odds of supporting Bush.

## 1988 elections analysis: Bayesian approach

- Due to the number of categories, the inference in the frequentist model is not entirely reliable as
  + it does not fully account for uncertainty in the estimated variance parameters, and 
  + it uses an approximation for inference. 
  
--

- We can fit the model under the Bayesian paradigm in the `brms` package, using mildly informative priors and quantify uncertainty based on the posterior samples.

--

- In-class analysis: move to the R script [here](https://ids-702-f19.github.io/Course-Website/slides/lec-slides/Elections88.R)

--

- Windows users: install Rtools for windows, then the `rstan` package in R. Mac users: install Xcode, Try `xcode-select --install` from the Terminal app or the Terminal tab of the RStudio console, then install the `rstan` package in R.
