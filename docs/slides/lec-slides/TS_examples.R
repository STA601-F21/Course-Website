#notice that the data go from latest to earliest date
#let's invert the order of the rows to make the time series increasing in date

#make a time series object of the closing prices
tsClose = ts(ftse100$Close)

#quite ugly!  hard to tell if this is stationary, and maybe not...
#let's look at autocorrelations

acf(ftse100$Close)
pacf(ftse100$Close)

#Looks like the autocorrelations are strong, but that lag 1 accounts for most of the autocorrelation

#Often it is better to work with returns for stock data

tsReturn = ts(ftse100$return)

#let's fit an AR(1) model to the returns anyways

ftsereturnmodel

#suppose you want to make a prediction of the returns six days ahead

predict(ftsereturnmodel, n.ahead = 6)

#often people use log returns for stocks, where they take log(Close/Open)
