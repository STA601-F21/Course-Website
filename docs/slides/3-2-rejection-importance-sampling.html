## Rejection sampling; Importance sampling

## Rejection sampling

- .hlight[Rejection sampling] and .hlight[Importance sampling] are one of the first steps into Monte Carlo analysis, in which simulated values from one distribution are used to explore another.

--

- Simulating from the "wrong distribution" can be incredibly useful as we will see in this module and also later in the course.

--

- Both are not used very often, but are still of practical interest in
  + fairly small problems, in terms of dimension, 
  
--
  + in which the density of the distribution of interest can be easily evaluated, but when it is difficult to sample from directly, and
  
--
  + when it is relatively easy to identify and simulate from distributions that approximate the distribution of interest.
  
--

- Importance sampling and Rejection sampling use the same ideas, but the latter leads to exact corrections and so exact samples from the distribution of interest.


---
## Rejection sampling

- Setup:
  + `\(p(\theta)\)` is some density we are interested in sampling from;
  
--
  + `\(p(\theta)\)` is tough to sample from but we are able to evaluate `\(p(\theta)\)` as a function at any point; and
  
--
  + `\(g(\theta)\)` is some .hlight[proposal distribution] or .hlight[importance sampling distribution] that is easier to sample from.

--

- Two key requirements:
  + `\(g(\theta)\)` is easy to sample from; and
  
--
  + `\(g(\theta)\)` is easy to evaluate at any point as is the case for `\(p(\theta)\)`.
  
--

- Usually, the context is one in which `\(g(\theta)\)` has been derived as an analytic approximation to `\(p(\theta)\)`; and the closer the approximation, the more accurate the resulting Monte Carlo analysis will be.



---
## Rejection sampling

- Procedure:

  1. Define `\(w(\theta) = p(\theta)/g(\theta)\)`.
  
--
  2. Assume that `\(w(\theta) = p(\theta)/g(\theta) &lt; M\)` for some constant M. If `\(g(\theta)\)` represents a good approximation to `\(p(\theta)\)`, then M should not be too far from 1.

--
  3. Generate a _candidate_ value `\(\theta \sim g(\theta)\)` and **accept** with probability `\(w(\theta)/M\)`: if accepted, `\(\theta\)` is a draw from `\(p(\theta)\)`; otherwise **reject** and try again.  
  
--
      Equivalently, generate `\(u \sim U(0,1)\)` independently of `\(\theta\)`. Then **accept** `\(\theta\)` as a draw from `\(p(\theta)\)` if, and only if, `\(u &lt; w(\theta)/M\)`.

--

- For those interested, the proof that all accepted `\(\theta\)` values are indeed from `\(p(\theta)\)` is on the next slide. We will not spend time on it.

--

- Clearly, we need `\(M\)` for this to work. However, in the case of truncated densities, we actually have `\(M\)`.



---
## Proof for simple accept/reject

- We need to show that all accepted `\(\theta\)` values are indeed from `\(p(\theta)\)`. Equivalently, show that `\(f(\theta | u &lt; w(\theta)/M) = p(\theta)\)`.

- By Bayes' theorem,
.block[
.small[
`$$f(\theta | u &lt; w(\theta)/M) = \dfrac{\Pr(\theta \textrm{ and } u &lt; w(\theta)/M)}{\Pr(u &lt; w(\theta)/M)} = \dfrac{\Pr(u &lt; w(\theta)/M \ | \ \theta) g(\theta)}{\Pr(u &lt; w(\theta)/M)}.$$`
]
]

- But,
  + `\(\Pr(u &lt; w(\theta)/M \ | \ \theta) = w(\theta)/M\)` since `\(u \sim U(0,1)\)`, and
  
  + 
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
\Pr(u &lt; w(\theta)/M) &amp; = \int \Pr(u &lt; w(\theta)/M \ | \ \theta) g(\theta) d\theta\\
&amp; = \int w(\theta)/M g(\theta) d\theta = 1/M \int w(\theta) g(\theta) d\theta = 1/M \int p(\theta) d\theta = 1/M.
\end{split}`
$$
]
]


- Therefore,
.block[
.small[
`$$f(\theta | u &lt; w(\theta)/M) = \dfrac{\Pr(u &lt; w(\theta)/M \ | \ \theta) g(\theta)}{\Pr(u &lt; w(\theta)/M)} = \dfrac{w(\theta)/M g(\theta)}{1/M} = w(\theta) g(\theta) = p(\theta).$$`
]
]

## Rejection sampling for truncated densities

- The inverse CDF method works well for truncated densities but what happens when we can not or prefer not to write down the truncated CDF?

--

- Suppose we want to sample from `\(f_{[a,b]}(\theta)\)`, that is, a known pdf `\(f(\theta)\)` truncated to `\([a,b]\)`.

  + Recall that `\(f_{[a,b]}(\theta) \propto f(\theta)\mathbb{1}[\theta \in [a,b]]\)`. Using the notation for rejection sampling, `\(p(\theta) = f_{[a,b]}(\theta)\)` and `\(g(\theta) = f(\theta)\)`.
  
--

  + Set `\(1/M = \int^b_a f(\theta^\star)\textrm{d}\theta^\star\)`, so that `\(M\)` is the normalizing constant of the truncated density.
  
--

  + Then, `\(w(\theta) = p(\theta)/g(\theta) = M \mathbb{1}[\theta \in [a,b]] \leq M\)` as required.
  
  
  
---
## Rejection sampling for truncated densities

- We can then use the procedure on page 5 to generate the required samples. 

--

- Specifically,

--
  + For each `\(i=1,\ldots,m\)`, generate `\(\theta_i \sim f\)`. If `\(\theta_i \in [a,b]\)`, accept `\(\theta_i\)`, otherwise **reject** and try again. 
  
--
  + Easy to show that this is equivalent to accepting each `\(\theta_i\)` with probability `\(w(\theta)/M\)`.





---
## Example


```r
#Simple code for using rejection sampling to generate m samples
#from the Beta[10,10] density truncated to (0.35,0.6).
set.seed(12345)
#NOTE: there are more efficient ways to write this code!

#set sample size and reate vector to store sample
m &lt;- 10000; THETA &lt;- rep(0,m)
#keep track of rejects
TotalRejects &lt;- 0; Rejections &lt;- NULL
#now the 'for loop'
for(i in 1:m){
  t &lt;- 0
  while(t &lt; 1){
    theta &lt;- rbeta(1,10,10)
    if(theta &gt; 0.35 &amp; theta &lt; 0.6){
      THETA[i] &lt;- theta
      t &lt;- 1
    } else {
    TotalRejects &lt;- TotalRejects + 1
    Rejections &lt;- rbind(Rejections,theta)
  }
}
}
#Overall acceptance rate:
1 - TotalRejects/(m+TotalRejects)
```

```

## Comments

- Clearly less efficient than the inverse CDF method, which we already know how to use for this particular problem.

--

- When you can write down the truncated CDF, use the inverse CDF method instead.

--

- When you cannot, rejection sampling can be a possible alternative, as are many more sampling methods which we will not cover in this course.

--

- Anyway, generally, rejection sampling can still be very useful.

--

- Importance sampling is another related sampling method but we will not spend time on it. If you are interested, take a look at the next few slides. If not, feel free to skip.

## Importance sampling

- Interest lies in expectations of the form (instead of the actual samples)
.block[
`$$H = \int h(\theta) p(\theta) d\theta,$$`
]

- Write
.block[
`$$H = \int h(\theta) w(\theta) g(\theta) d\theta \ \ \ \textrm{with} \ \ \ w(\theta) = p(\theta)/g(\theta)$$`
]

  that is, `\(\mathbb{E}[h(\theta)]\)` under `\(p(\theta)\)` is just `\(\mathbb{E}[h(\theta) w(\theta)]\)` under `\(g(\theta)\)`.
  
- Using direct Monte Carlo integration
.block[
`$$\bar{h} = \dfrac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m w(\theta_i) h(\theta_i).$$`
]

  where `\(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_m \overset{ind}{\sim} g(\theta)\)`. We are sampling from the "wrong" distribution.



---
## Importance sampling

- The measure of "how wrong" we are at each simulated `\(\theta_m\)` value is the .hlight[importance weight]
.block[
`$$w(\theta_i) = p(\theta_i)/g(\theta_i).$$`
]

--

- These ratios weight the sample estimates `\(h(\theta_i)\)` to "correct" for the fact that we sampled the wrong distribution.
  
- See [Lopes &amp; Gamerman (Ch 3.4)](https://www.amazon.com/Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo-Statistical/dp/1584885874) and [Robert and Casella (Ch. 3.3)](https://www.amazon.com/Monte-Statistical-Methods-Springer-Statistics/dp/1441919392) for discussions of convergence and optimality.

--

- Clearly, the closer `\(g\)` is to `\(p\)`, the better the results, just as we had with rejection sampling.



---
## Importance sampling

- Key considerations:
  + MC estimate `\(\bar{h}\)` has the expectation `\(H\)`; and is generally almost surely convergent to `\(H\)` (under certain conditions of course but we will not dive into those).
  
--
  + `\(\mathbb{V}[\bar{h}]\)` is often going to be finite in cases in which, generally, `\(w(\theta) = p(\theta)/g(\theta)\)` is bounded and decays rapidly in the tails of `\(p(\theta)\)`.
  
--
  + Thus, superior MC approximations, are achieved for choices of `\(g(\theta)\)` whose tails dominate those of the target `\(p(\theta)\)`.
  
--
  + That is, importance sampling distributions should be chosen to have tails at least as fat as the target (think normal distribution vs t-distribution).
  
--
  + Obviously require the support of `\(g(\theta)\)` to be the same as, or contain, that of `\(p(\theta)\)`.
  
--

- These also clearly apply to rejection sampling too.
  
  
  
---
## Importance sampling

- Problems in which `\(w(\theta) = p(\theta)/g(\theta)\)` can be computed are actually rare.

--

- As you will see when we move away from conjugate distributions, we usually only know `\(p(\theta)\)` up to a normalizing constant.

--

- When this is the case, simply "re-normalize" the importance weights, so that
.block[
`$$\bar{h} = \dfrac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m w_i h(\theta_i) \ \ \ \textrm{where} \ \ \ w_i = \dfrac{w(\theta_i)}{\sum^m_{i=1}w(\theta_i)}.$$`
]

--

- Generally, in importance sampling, weights that are close to uniform are desirable, and very unevenly distributed weights are not.
