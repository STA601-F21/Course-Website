# STA 360/602L: Module 7.1
## The Metropolis algorithm
### Dr. Olanrewaju Michael Akande

## Introduction

- As a refresher, suppose `\(y = (y_1,\ldots,y_n)\)` and each `\(y_i \sim p(y | \theta)\)`. Suppose we specify a prior `\(\pi(\theta)\)` on `\(\theta\)`.

--

- Then as usual, we are interested in
.block[
.small[
`$$\pi(\theta | y) = \frac{\pi(\theta)p(y,|\theta)}{\mathcal{p}(y)}.$$`
]
]

--

- As we already know, it is often difficult to compute `\(\mathcal{p}(y)\)`.

--

- Using the Monte Carlo method or Gibbs sampler, we have seen that we don't need to know `\(p(y)\)`. 

--

- As long as we have conjugate and semi-conjugate priors, we can generate samples directly from `\(\pi(\theta | y)\)`.

--

- What happens if we cannot sample directly from `\(\pi(\theta | y)\)`?



---
## Motivating example

- To motivate our discussions on the Metropolis algorithm, let's explore a simple example.

--

- Suppose we wish to sample from the following density
.block[
$$
`\begin{split}
\pi(\theta | y) \propto \text{exp}^{-\dfrac{1}{2}\theta^2} + \dfrac{1}{2} \text{exp}^{-\dfrac{1}{2}(\theta-3)^2}
\end{split}`
$$
]

--

- This is a _mixture of two normal densities_, one with mode near 0 and the other with mode near 3.  
  
--

- _**Note**: we will cover finite mixture models properly soon_.

--

- Anyway, let's use this density to explore the main ideas behind the Metropolis sampler.

--

- &lt;div class="question"&gt;
By the way, as you will see, we don't actually  need to know the normalizing constant for Metropolis sampling but for this example, find it for practice!
&lt;/div&gt;




---
## Motivating example

- Let's take a look at the (normalized) density:
&lt;img src="7-1-metropolis-I_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

- There are other ways of sampling from this density, but let's focus specifically on the Metropolis algorithm here.




---
## Metropolis algorithm

- From a sampling perspective, we need to have a large group of values, `\(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(S)}\)` from `\(\pi(\theta | y)\)` whose empirical distribution approximates `\(\pi(\theta | y)\)`.

--

- That means that for any two values `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`, we want
.block[
.small[
`$$\dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} = a}{S} \div \dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} = b}{S} = \dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} = a}{S} \times \dfrac{S}{\# \theta^{(s)} = b} = \dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} = a}{\# \theta^{(s)} = b} \approx \dfrac{\pi(\theta = a | y)}{\pi(\theta = b | y)}$$`
]
]

--

- Basically, we want to make sure that if `\(a\)` and `\(b\)` are plausible values in `\(\pi(\theta | y)\)`, the ratio of the number of the `\(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(S)}\)` values equal to them properly approximates `\(\dfrac{\pi(\theta = a | y)}{\pi(\theta = b | y)}\)`.

--

- How might we construct a group like this?



---
## Metropolis algorithm

- Suppose we have a working group `\(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}\)` at iteration `\(s\)`, and need to add a new value `\(\theta^{(s+1)}\)`.

--

- Consider a candidate value `\(\theta^\star\)` that is close to `\(\theta^{(s)}\)` _(we will get to how to generate the candidate value in a minute)_. Should we set `\(\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^\star\)` or not?

--

- Well, we should probably compute `\(\pi(\theta^\star | y)\)` and see if `\(\pi(\theta^\star | y) &gt; \pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)\)`. Equivalently, look at `\(r = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star | y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)}\)`.

--

- By the way, notice that
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
r &amp; = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star | y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)} = \dfrac{p(y | \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y)} \div \dfrac{p(y | \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})}{p(y)}\\
\\
&amp; =  \dfrac{p(y | \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y)} \times \dfrac{p(y)}{p(y | \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})} = \dfrac{p(y | \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y | \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})},
\end{split}`
$$
]
]

  which does not depend on the marginal likelihood we don't know!




---
## Metropolis algorithm

- If `\(r &gt; 1\)`
  + Intuition: `\(\theta^{(s)}\)` is already a part of the density we desire and the density at `\(\theta^\star\)` is even higher than the density at `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`.
  
  + Action: set `\(\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^\star\)`

--

- If `\(r &lt; 1\)`, 
  + Intuition: relative frequency of values on our group `\(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}\)` equal to `\(\theta^\star\)` should be `\(\approx r = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star | y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)}\)`. For every `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`, include only a fraction of an instance of `\(\theta^\star\)`.
  
  + Action: set `\(\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^\star\)` with probability `\(r\)` and `\(\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^{(s)}\)` with probability `\(1-r\)`.



---
## Metropolis algorithm

- This is the basic intuition behind the .hlight[Metropolis algorithm].

--

- Where should the proposed value `\(\theta^\star\)` come from? 

--

- Sample `\(\theta^\star\)` close to the current value `\(\theta^{(s)}\)` using a .hlight[symmetric proposal distribution] `\(g[\theta^\star | \theta^{(s)}]\)`. `\(g\)` is actually a "family of proposal distributions", indexed by the specific value of `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`.

--

- Here, symmetric means that `\(g[\theta^\star | \theta^{(s)}] = g[\theta^{(s)} | \theta^\star]\)`. 

--

- The symmetric proposal is usually very simple with density concentrated near `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`, for example, `\(\mathcal{N}(\theta^\star; \theta^{(s)}, \delta^2)\)` or `\(\text{Unif}(\theta^\star; \theta^{(s)} - \delta, \theta^{(s)} + \delta)\)`.

--

- After obtaining `\(\theta^\star\)`, either add it or add a copy of `\(\theta^{(s)}\)` to our current set of values, depending on the value of `\(r\)`.



---
## Metropolis algorithm

- The algorithm proceeds as follows:

  1. Given `\(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}\)`, generate a _candidate_ value `\(\theta^\star \sim g[\theta^\star | \theta^{(s)}]\)`.
  
--

  2. Compute the acceptance ratio
  .block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
r &amp; = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star | y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} | y)} = \dfrac{p(y | \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y | \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})}.
\end{split}`
$$
]
]

--

  3. Set
  .block[
.small[
`\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta^{(s+1)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\theta^\star &amp; \quad \text{with probability} \quad \text{min}(r,1) \\
\theta^{(s)} &amp; \quad \text{with probability} \quad 1 - \text{min}(r,1) \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray*}`
]
]

      which can be accomplished by sampling `\(u \sim U(0,1)\)` independently and setting
  .block[
.small[
`\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta^{(s+1)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\theta^\star &amp; \quad \text{if} \quad u &lt; r \\
\theta^{(s)} &amp; \quad \text{if} \quad \text{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right. .
\end{eqnarray*}`
]
]



---
## Metropolis algorithm

- Once we obtain the samples, then we are back to using Monte Carlo approximations for quantities of interest.

--

- That is, we can again approximate posterior means, quantiles, and other quantities of interest using the empirical distribution of our sampled values.

--

- _Some notes:_
  + The Metropolis chain ALWAYS moves to the proposed `\(\theta^\star\)` at iteration `\(s+1\)` if `\(\theta^\star\)` has
higher target density than the current `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`.

--

  + Sometimes, it also moves to a `\(\theta^\star\)` value with lower density in proportion to the density value itself. 

--

  + This leads to a random, Markov process than naturally explores the space according to the probability defined by `\(\pi(\theta | y)\)`, and hence generates a sequence that, while dependent, eventually represents draws from `\(\pi(\theta | y)\)`.



---
## Metropolis algorithm: convergence

- We will not cover the convergence theory behind Metropolis chains in detail, but below are a few notes for those interested:

--

  + The Markov process generated under this condition is .hlight[ergodic] and has a limiting distribution.

--

  + Here, think of ergodicity as meaning that the chain can move anywhere at each step, which is ensured, for example, if `\(g[\theta^\star | \theta^{(s)}] &gt; 0\)` everywhere!

--

  + By construction, it turns out that the Metropolis chains are .hlight[reversible], so that convergence to `\(\pi(\theta | y)\)` is assured.
  
--

  + Think of reversibility as being equivalent to symmetry of the joint density of two consecutive `\(\theta^{(s)}\)` and `\(\theta^{(s+1)}\)` in the stationary process, which we do have by using a symmetric proposal distribution.
  
--

- If you want to learn more about convergence of MCMC chains, consider taking one of the courses on stochastic processes, or Markov chain theory.



---
## Metropolis algorithm: tuning

- Correlation between samples can be adjusted by selecting optimal `\(\delta\)` (i.e., spread of the distribution) in the proposal distribution

--

- Decreasing correlation increases the effective sample size, increasing rate of convergence, and improving the Monte Carlo approximation to the posterior.

--

- However, 
  + `\(\delta\)` too small leads to `\(r \approx 1\)` for most proposed values, a high acceptance rate, but very small moves, leading to highly correlated chain.
  + `\(\delta\)` too large can get "stuck" at the posterior mode(s) because `\(\theta^\star\)` can get very far away from the mode, leading to a very low acceptance rate and again high correlation in the Markov chain.

--

- Thus, good to implement several short runs of the algorithm varying `\(\delta\)` and settle on one that yields acceptance rate in the range of 25-50%.

--

- Burn-in (and thinning) is even more important here!



---
## Metropolis in action

Back to our example with
.block[
$$
`\begin{split}
\pi(\theta | y) \propto \text{exp}^{-\dfrac{1}{2}\theta^2} + \dfrac{1}{2} \text{exp}^{-\dfrac{1}{2}(\theta-3)^2}
\end{split}`
$$
