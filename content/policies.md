### Prerequisites
ALL students are expected to be familiar with all the topics covered within the required prerequisites to be in this course. That is, STA 611 or the following: STA 210 and (STA 230 or 240L) and (MATH 202, 202D, 212, or 222) and (MATH 216, 218, or 221, any of which may be taken concurrently). Students are also expected to be very familiar with R and are encouraged to have learned LaTeX or a Markdown language by the end of the course.

The work hours will include time spent going through the preassigned readings, watching the lecture videos, watching or attending the lab sessions, and doing all graded work. Please note that the more focused and engaged you are, the quicker you will be able to get through all the materials.

### Graded Work

Graded work for the course will consist of problem sets, lab exercises, two quizzes, a midterm exam and a final exam. Most of the problem sets and lab exercises assigned to students enrolled in STA 602 will contain at least one question more than those assigned to students enrolled in STA 360. Regrade requests for homework and lab exercises must be done via Gradescope AT MOST **24 hours** after grades are released! Regrade requests for quizzes, midterm, and final exams must be done via Gradescope AT MOST **12 hours** after grades are released! **Always write in complete sentences and show all of your steps.**

Grades **may** be curved at the end of the semester. Cumulative averages of 90% -- 100% are guaranteed at least an A-, 80% -- 89% at least a B-, and 70% -- 79% at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam.


### Descriptions of graded work

#### Problem sets and lab exercises
There will be five problem sets which will be handed out on a weekly basis. They will be based on all topics covered in the lecture videos and assigned readings will often be posted on the website every Monday, so please check the website regularly!  **Also, please note that any work that is not legible by the instructor or TAs will not be graded (given a score  of 0). Every write-up must be clearly written in full sentences and clear English. Any assignment that is completely unclear to the instructors and/or TAs, may result in a grade of a 0.** For programming exercises, you are required to use R and you must submit ALL of the code as an appendix.  

Each student MUST write up and turn in her or his own answers. You are encouraged to talk to each other regarding homework problems or to the instructor/TA. However, the write-up, solution, and code must be entirely your own work. The assignments must be submitted on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/77790/assignments) under ``Assignments''. Note that you will not be able to make online submissions after the due date, so be sure to submit before or by the Gradescope-specified deadline.

Homework solutions will be curated from student solutions with proper attribution. Every week the TAs will select a representative correct solution for the assigned problems and put them together into one solutions set with each answer being attributed to the student who wrote it. **If you would like to OPT OUT of having your homework solutions used for the class solutions, please let the Instructor and TAs know in advance.**

**Finally, your lowest homework score will be dropped!**

#### Lab exercises
The objective of the lab assignments is to give you more hands-on experience with Bayesian data analysis.zhuoqun.wang@duke.edu Come learn a concept or two and some R from the TAs and then work on the computational part of the homework assignments. Lab attendance is not mandatory, however, each lab assignment should be submitted in timely fashion on the due date. You are REQUIRED to use R Markdown to type up your lab reports.

#### Quizzes
There will be two quizzes, both timed and online. Students will be able to take the quiz within any one-hour slot in a 24-hour window. Detailed instructions on the quizzes will be made available later.

Soon after the midterm, you will be given a midterm grade assessing your overall performance. Note that the main purpose of this is to let you know how you are doing in the class. Detailed instructions on the midterm will be made available later.

#### Final Exam
There will be a final exam, which you will be able to take between August 7 and August 9. If you miss any quiz or the midterm, your grade will depend more on the final exam score since there are no make-up exams. You cannot miss the final exam! Students will be able to take the final within any three-hour slot in a 48-hour window. Detailed instructions on the final will be made available later.
