# Missing data


---
## Motivation

- Most real world datasets often suffer from nonresponse, that is, they contain missing values.

--

- Ideally, analysts should first decide on how to deal with missing data before moving on to analysis. 

--

- One needs to make assumptions and ask tons of questions, for example,
  + why are the values missing?
  + what is the pattern of missingness?
  + what is the proportion of missing values in the data?

--

- As a Bayesian, one could treat the missing values as parameters and estimate them simultaneously with the analysis, but even in that case, one must still ask the same questions.

--

- Ask as many questions as possible to help you figure out the most plausible assumptions!


---
## Motivation

- Simplest approach: complete/available case analyses -- delete cases with missing data. Often problematic because:
  + it is just not feasible sometimes (small `\(n\)` large `\(p\)` problem) -- when we have a small number of observations but a large number of variables, we simply can not afford to throw away data, even when the proportion of missing data is small.
  
--

  + information loss -- even when we do not have the small `\(n\)`, large `\(p\)` problem, we still lose information when we delete cases.
  
--

  + biased results -- because the missing data mechanism is rarely random, features of the observed data can be completely different from the missing data.

--
  
- More principled approach: impute the missing data (in a statistically proper fashion) and analyze the imputed data.



---
## Why should we care?

- &lt;font color="red"&gt;Loss of power&lt;/font&gt;
  + can't regain lost power

--
  
- Any analysis must make an &lt;font color="red"&gt;untestable assumption&lt;/font&gt; about the missing data
  + wrong assumption `\(\Rightarrow\)` &lt;font color="red"&gt;biased estimates&lt;/font&gt;

--
  
- Some popular analyses with missing data get &lt;font color="red"&gt;biased standard errors&lt;/font&gt;
  + resulting in wrong p-values and confidence intervals

--

- Some popular analyses with missing data are &lt;font color="red"&gt;inefficient&lt;/font&gt;
  + so that confidence intervals wider than they need be


---
## What to do: loss of power

Approach by design:

- minimize amount of missing data
  + good communications with participants, for example, patients in clinical trial, participants in surveys and censuses, etc
  + follow up as much as possible; make repeated attempts using different methods

--
    
- reduce the impact of missing data
  + collect reasons for missing data
  + collect information predictive of missing values
    
    
---
## What to do: analysis

- A suitable method of analysis would:
  + make the correct assumption about the missing data
  + give an unbiased estimate (under that assumption)
  + give an unbiased standard error (so that P-values and confidence intervals are correct)
  + be efficient (make best use of the available data)

--
  
- However, we can never be sure about what the correct assumption is `\(\Rightarrow\)` sensitivity analyses are essential!


---
## How to approach the analysis?

- Start by knowing:
  + extent of missing data
  + pattern of missing data (e.g. is `\(X_1\)` always missing whenever `\(X_2\)` is also missing?)
  + predictors of missing data and of outcome

--
  
- Principled approach to missing data:
  + identify a plausible assumption (through discussions between you as a data scientist and your clients)
  + choose an analysis method that's valid under that assumption
  
--

- Just because a method is simple to use does not make it plausible; some analysis methods are simple to describe but have complex and/or implausible assumptions.


---
## Types of nonresponse (missing data)

- .hlight[Unit nonresponse]: the individual has no values recorded for any of the variables.

- .hlight[Item nonresponse]: the individual has values recorded for at least one variable, but not all variables.

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Unit nonresponse vs item nonresponse&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th height="30px" colspan="3"&gt;Variables&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td rowspan="3"&gt; Item nonresponse &lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td height="30px" style="text-align:center"&gt; &amp;#10004 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt; &amp;#10067 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td height="30px" style="text-align:center"&gt; &amp;#10067 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt; &amp;#10067 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td height="30px" style="text-align:center"&gt; &amp;#10067 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt; &amp;#10004 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td height="30px" style="text-align:left"&gt; Unit nonresponse &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt; &amp;#10067 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt; &amp;#10067 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt; &amp;#10067 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

## Types of Missing Data Mechanism

- Data are said to be .hlight[missing completely at random (MCAR)] if the reason for missingness does not depend on the values of the observed data or missing data.

--

- For example, suppose
  - you handed out a double-sided survey questionnaire of 20 questions to a sample of participants;
  - questions 1-15 were on the first page but questions 16-20 were at the back; and
  - some of the participants did not respond to questions 16-20
 
--
 
- Then, the values for questions 16-20 for those people who did not respond would be .hlight[missing completely at random] if they simply did not realize the pages were double-sided; they had no reason to ignore those questions
 
--
 
- This is rarely plausible in practice!


---
## Types of Missing Data Mechanism

- Data are said to be .hlight[missing at random (MAR)] if the reason for missingness may depend on the values of the observed data but not the missing data (conditional on the values of the observed data).

--

- Using our previous example, suppose
  - questions 1-15 include demographic information such as age and education;
  - questions 16-20 include income related questions; and
  - once again, some of the participants did not respond to questions 16-20

--
  
- Then, the values for questions 16-20 for those people who did not respond would be .hlight[missing at random] if younger people are more likely not to respond to those income related questions than old people, where age is observed for all participants.
  
--

- This is the most commonly assumed mechanism in practice!


---
## Types of Missing Data Mechanism

- Data are said to be .hlight[missing not at random (MNAR or NMAR)] if the reason for missingness depends on the actual values of the missing (unobserved) data.

--

- Continuing with our previous example, suppose again that
  - questions 1-15 include demographic information such as age and education;
  - questions 16-20 include income related questions; and
  - once again, some of the participants did not respond to questions 16-20

--
  
- Then, the values for questions 16-20 for those people who did not respond would be .hlight[missing not at random] if people who earn more money are less likely to respond to those income related questions than old people.

--
  
- This is usually the case in real analysis, but analysis can be complex!


---
## Mathematical Formulation

- Consider the classical multiple regression setting with
.block[
.small[
`$$\boldsymbol{Y} = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}; \ \ \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon \boldsymbol{I})$$`
]
]

	where `\(\boldsymbol{I}\)` is the identity matrix and
.block[
.small[
$$
\boldsymbol{Y} =
`\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
\vdots\\
y_n \\
\end{bmatrix}`
\hspace{0.5em}
\boldsymbol{X} =
`\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; x_{11} &amp; x_{12} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_{1p} \\
1 &amp; x_{21} &amp; x_{22} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_{2p} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
1 &amp; x_{n1} &amp; x_{n2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_{np} \\
\end{bmatrix}`
\hspace{0.5em}
\boldsymbol{\beta} =
`\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0\\
\beta_1\\
\beta_2 \\
\vdots \\
\beta_p \\
\end{bmatrix}`
\hspace{0.5em}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon} =
`\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_1\\
\epsilon_2 \\
\vdots \\
\epsilon_n \\
\end{bmatrix}`
$$ 
]
]

--
	
- Suppose for now, that `\(\boldsymbol{Y}\)` contains missing values but `\(\boldsymbol{X}\)` is fully observed.

--

- We can separate `\(\boldsymbol{Y}\)` into the observed and missing parts, that is, `\(\boldsymbol{Y} = (\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis})\)`. 

--

- We can also do the same for `\(\boldsymbol{X}\)` if it contains missing values.


---
## Mathematical Formulation

- Let 
  + `\(r_i = 1\)` when `\(y_i\)` is missing,
  + `\(r_i = 0\)` when `\(y_i\)` is observed.

--

- Also, let 
  + `\(\boldsymbol{R} = (r_1,\ldots,r_n)\)` (this is the vector of missing indicators for `\(\boldsymbol{Y}\)`),
  + `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` be the set of parameters associated with `\(\boldsymbol{R}\)`.

--

- When `\(\boldsymbol{X}\)` contains missing values, we can also create a vector of missing indicators for each variable in `\(\boldsymbol{X}\)` with missing entries.

--

- Assume `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` and `\((\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon)\)` are distinct.


---
## Mathematical Formulation

- MCAR:
.block[
`$$f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta})$$`
]

--

- MAR:
.block[
`$$f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta})$$`
]

--

- MNAR:
.block[
`$$f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta})$$`
]



---
## Implications for likelihood function for parameters

- Each type of mechanism has a different implication on the likelihood of the observed data `\(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}\)`, and the missing data indicator `\(\boldsymbol{R}\)`.

--

- Without missingness in `\(\boldsymbol{Y}\)`, the likelihood function is
.block[
`$$L(\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}) \propto f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon)$$`
]

--

- With missingness in `\(\boldsymbol{Y}\)`, the likelihood function is instead
.block[
$$
`\begin{split}
L(\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R}) &amp; \propto f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
&amp; = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
\end{split}`
$$
]

--

- Since we do not actually observe `\(\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis}\)`, we would like to be able to integrate it out so we don't have to deal with it.



---
## Likelihood function: MCAR

For MCAR, we have:

.block[
$$
`\begin{split}
f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) &amp; = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
&amp; = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
&amp; = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) \int f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
&amp; = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon). \\
\end{split}`
$$
]

--

That is, the likelihood function is
.block[
$$
`\begin{split}
L(\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R}) &amp; \propto f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
&amp; = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon). \\
\end{split}`
$$
]

--

For inference on `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` and `\(\sigma^2_\epsilon\)`, we can simply focus on `\(f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon)\)` in the likelihood function, since `\(f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\theta})\)` does not include any part of the observed data.



---
## Likelihood function: MAR

For MAR, we have:

.block[
$$
`\begin{split}
f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) &amp; = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
&amp; = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
&amp; = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) \int f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} \\
&amp; = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon). \\
\end{split}`
$$
]

--

That is, the likelihood function is
.block[
$$
`\begin{split}
L(\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R}) &amp; \propto f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
&amp; = f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon). \\
\end{split}`
$$
]

--

For inference on `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` and `\(\sigma^2_\epsilon\)`, we can again focus on `\(f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon)\)` in the likelihood function. However, `\(f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta})\)` does include the observed data here, so that there would be some bias if we do not account for it.


---
## Likelihood function: MNAR

For MNAR, we have:

.block[
$$
`\begin{split}
f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs}, \boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon,\boldsymbol{\theta}) &amp; = \int f(\boldsymbol{R} | \boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis},\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{\theta}) f(\boldsymbol{Y}_{obs},\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis} | \boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2_\epsilon) \textrm{d}\boldsymbol{Y}_{mis}. \\
\end{split}`
$$
]

--

  + The likelihood under MNAR cannot simplify any further.
  + In this case, we cannot ignore the missing data when making inferences about `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` and `\(\sigma^2_\epsilon\)`.


---
## Types of missing data mechanisms: how to tell in practice?

So how can we tell the type of mechanism we are dealing with? 

--

In general, we don't know!!!

--

- Rare that data are MCAR (unless planned beforehand)

--

- Possible that data are MNAR

--

- Compromise: assume data are MAR if we include enough variables in model for the missing data indicator `\(\boldsymbol{R}\)`.

# Strategies for handling missing data


---
## Strategies for handling missing data

- Item nonresponse:
  + use complete/available cases analyses
  + single imputation methods
  + multiple imputation
  + model-based methods

--
  
- Unit nonresponse: 
  + weighting adjustments
  + model-based methods (identifiability issues!).

--
  
- We will only focus on item nonresponse. If you are interested in building models for both unit and item nonresponse, here is a paper on research I have done on the topic: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06145.pdf


---
## Complete/available cases analyses

What can happen when using available case analyses with different types of missing data?

--

- MCAR: unbiased when disregarding missing data; variance increase (losing partially complete data)

--

- MAR: biased (depending on the strength of MAR and amount of missing data) when missing data mechanism is not modeled; variance increase (losing partially complete data). 

--

- NMAR: generally biased!


---
## Why should we care?

- &lt;div class="question"&gt;
Why should we care in practice? What does bias really mean here? How exactly does using only the complete cases affect our results for the three mechanisms?
&lt;/div&gt;

- Let's attempt to answer these questions via simulations. 

- Set `\(n = 10,000\)`. For `\(i=1,\ldots,n\)`, generate
  + `\(x_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(2, 1); \ \  \ y_i|x_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(-1 + 2 x_{i}, \sigma^2=5^2)\)`
  + `\(r_i|y_i, x_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 y_i + \theta_2 x_i\)`
  
- Next, set `\(y_i\)` missing whenever `\(r_i = 1\)`.

- Set different values for `\(\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_0, \theta_1, \theta_2)\)` to reflect MCAR, MAR and MNAR.

- Let's use the R script [here](https://ids-702-f19.github.io/Course-Website/slides/lec-slides/MissingDataSim.R).


---
## Single imputation methods

--

- Marginal/conditional mean imputation

--

- Nearest neighbor imputation:
  + hot deck imputation
  + cold deck imputation

--

- Use observation from one of the previous time periods (for panel data)
  + LOCF -- last observation carried forward 
  + BOCF -- baseline observation carried forward
  
  
---
## Mean imputation

Plug in the variable mean for missing values.

--

- Point estimates of means OK under MCAR

--

- Variances and covariances underestimated.

--

- Distributional characteristics altered.

--

- Regression coefficients inaccurate.

--

Similar problems for plug-in conditional means.


---
## Nearest neighbor imputation

Plug in donors' observed values.

--

- Hot deck: for each non-respondent, find a respondent who "looks like" the non-respondent in the same dataset

--

- Cold deck: find potential donors in an external but similar dataset. For example, respondents from a 2016 election poll survey might serve as potential donors for non-respondents in the 2018 version of the same survey.

--

- Common metrics: Statistical distance, adjustment cells, propensity scores.


---
## Nearest neighbor imputation

- Point estimates of means OK under MAR.

--

- Variances and covariances underestimated.

--

- Distributional characteristics OK.

--

- Regression coefficients OK under MAR.


---
## Multiple imputation (MI)

- Fill in data sets `\(m\)` times with imputations.

--

- Analyze repeated data sets separately, then combine the estimates from each one.

--

- Imputations drawn from probability models for missing data.

--

---
## MI example

Suppose

- `\(Y =\)` income (unit of measurement is $10,000)

--

- `\(X =\)` level of education (0 = undergraduate, 1 = graduate)

--

---
## MI: inferences from multiply-imputed datasets

Rubin (1987)

- Population estimand: `\(Q\)`

- Sample estimate: `\(q\)`

- Variance of `\(q\)`: `\(u\)`

- In each imputed dataset `\(d_j\)`, where `\(j = 1,\ldots,m\)`, calculate
`$$q_j = q(d_j)$$`
`$$u_j = u(d_j)$$`

---
## MI example: inferences from multiply-imputed datasets

Suppose we are interested in estimating the mean income in our example.  Then

- Q = `\(\mu_Y\)`

--

- `\(q = \bar{y} =  \dfrac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} y_i\)`

--

- u = `\(\mathbb{\hat{V}}[\bar{y}] = \dfrac{s^2}{n}\)`

--

- In each imputed dataset `\(d_j\)`, calculate
`$$q_j =  \bar{y}_j \ \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \ u_j = \dfrac{s_j^2}{n}$$`


---
## MI: quantities needed for inference

- .block[
`$$\bar{q}_m = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \dfrac{q_i}{m}$$`
]

- .block[
`$$b_m = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \dfrac{(q_i - \bar{q}_m)^2}{m-1}$$`
]

- .block[
`$$\bar{u}_m = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \dfrac{u_i}{m}$$`
]


---
## MI: inferences from multiply-imputed datasets

- MI estimate of `\(Q\)`:
.block[
`$$\bar{q}_m$$`
]

--

- MI estimate of variance is:
.block[
`$$T_m = (1+1/m)b_m + \bar{u}_m$$`
]

--
	
- Use t-distribution inference for `\(Q\)`
.block[
`$$\bar{q}_m \pm t_{1-\alpha/2} \sqrt{T_m}$$`
]
	
  .hlight[Notice that the variance incorporates uncertainty both from within and between the m datasets.]



---
## MI example

Back to our income example,

&lt;img src="img/MIExample-II.png" height="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

By the way, `\(\bar{y}=12.64\)` from the "true complete dataset".


---
## MI example

- MI estimate of `\(Q\)`: 
.small[
	`$$\bar{q}_m = \sum\limits_{j=1}^m \dfrac{q_j}{m} = \dfrac{12.66 + 13.14 + 12.90}{3} = 12.90$$`
	]

--

- Between variance 
.small[
	`$$b_m = \sum\limits_{j=1}^m \dfrac{(q_j - \bar{q}_m)^2}{m-1} =  0.06$$`
	]

--

- Within variance 
.small[
	`$$\bar{u}_m = \sum\limits_{j=1}^m \dfrac{u_j}{m} = \dfrac{0.37 + 0.29 + 0.32}{3} = 0.33$$`
	]

--

- MI estimate of variance is: 
.small[
	`$$T_m = (1+1/m)b_m + \bar{u}_m = (1+1/3)0.06 + 0.33 = 0.41$$`
	]

 &lt;div class="question"&gt;
Where should the imputations come from? We will answer that in the next class!
